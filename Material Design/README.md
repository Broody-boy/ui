Android material Design Examples
==============

SimpleDemo is basic example of using Material design.  There is no real java code here, it's all in the values/color and styles.xml files (values and values-v21).  There are also two screenshots device-4.4.png and device-5.0.png to show how style looks.

ToolbarDemo uses the v7.toolbar and style pieces.  see the app_bar.xml and activity_mail.xml, plus main_activity.java for the bulk of the code.  Again device-4.4.png and device-5.0.png shows the design.

navDrawerDemo is Navigation bar demo with the colors and toolbarnavDrawerDemo is the same example, but uses the toolbar.  See pictures in the directories for the differences.

CirToolbarNavDrawerDemo uses toolbarnavDrawerDemo and adds the Floating Action button (using a library from https://github.com/shamanland/floating-action-button) 
A somewhat helpful guide to adding libraries: http://youtu.be/1MyBO9z7ojk 

talltoolbarDemo is just replicating googles material Design with an extended toolbar as an example.

RecyclerViewDemo is a very simple example of how to use a RecyclerView and CardView (via support.v7).   Note a RecyclerView is a more powerful listview, which was introduced into android 5 and the support.v7 library.

RecyclerViewDemo2 is more complex version using RecyclerView and CardView (support.v7). This example uses the phonelist from the listview example as the data set.

LotsofLists is a complex demo using a Navigation bar and RecyclerView to display several different lists, plus you can add more items the lists and add more lists to the navigation as well.

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.  All examples are for Android.
