Android material Design Examples
==============

SimpleDemo is basic example of using Material design.  There is no real java code here, it's all in the values/color and styles.xml files (values and values-v21)  There is also two screenshots device-4.4.png and device-5.0.png to show how style looks.

ToolbarDemo uses the v7.toolbar and style pieces.  see the app_bar.xml and activity_mail.xml, plus main_activity.java for the bulk of the code.  Again device-4.4.png and device-5.0.png shows the design.



These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.  All examples are for Android
