Android material Design Examples
==============

SimpleDemo is basic example of using Material design.  There is no real java code here, it's all in the values/color and styles.xml files (values and values-v21)  There is also two screenshots device-4.4.png and device-5.0.png to show how style looks.

ToolbarDemo uses the v7.toolbar and style pieces.  see the app_bar.xml and activity_mail.xml, plus main_activity.java for the bulk of the code.  Again device-4.4.png and device-5.0.png shows the design.

navDrawerDemo is Navigation bar demo with the colors and toolbarnavDrawerDemo is the same example, but uses the toolbar.  See pictures in the directories for the differences.

RecyclerViewDemo is a very simple example of how to use a RecyclerView and CardView (via support.v7).   Note a RecyclerView is a more powerful listview, which was introduced into android 5 and the support.v7 library.

RecyclerViewDemo2 is more complex version using RecyclerView and CardView (support.v7). This example uses the phonelist from the listview example as the data set.

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.  All examples are for Android
