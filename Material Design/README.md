Android material Design Examples
==============

<b>SimpleDemo</b> is basic example of using Material design.  There is no real java code here, it's all in the values/color and styles.xml files (values and values-v21).  There are also two screenshots device-4.4.png and device-5.0.png to show how style looks.

<b>CirToolbarNavDrawerDemo</b> uses toolbarnavDrawerDemo and uses the support design floating action button.  Previous versions used adds the Floating Action button (using a library from https://github.com/makovkastar/FloatingActionButton)

<b>SupportDesignDemo</b> is demo of some of the support Design widgets.  Floating action Button, inputtextlayout, snack bar, and using the snackbar and floating action button together (hint the fab moves out of the way).

<b>snackbarDemo</b>  show the snackbar triggered from a fab.  It also show how the callbacks works, so you can determine how the
user dealt with the snackbar (ie swiped it away, timed out, etc ).

<b>snackbarExtendedDemo</b> show how to set the snackbar to indefinite, so it will continue to show, until we programmatically dismiss it.

<b>SupportDesignDemo2</b> uses the support design tablayout with a viewpager.  The new methods use the support design tablayout.  They are just as easy to use as the stripetab with the viewpager, but you need 2 extra lines of code to setup it up.

<b>SupportDesignDemo3</b> show how to use a picture with the toolbar and how to collapse the picture.  Also a little bit with the support design pallete.

<b>SupportDesignDemo4</b> show how to use the larger toolbar and how to collapse it as well.

<b>SupportPaletteDemo</b> A simple example using a bitmap to get the palette and change the some textviews with it.  The example uses 4 different images that
change via a imagebutton.

<b>SupportDesignBottomNavDemo</b> shows how to use the ButtomNavigationView (introduced in v25) in the support design library.

Note the recyclerview demos were moved to their own directory.

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course and cosc 4735 Advance Mobile Programing course.  All examples are for Android.
