Android RecyclerView Examples
==============

<b>RecyclerViewDemo</b> is a very simple example of how to use a RecyclerView and CardView (via support.v7).   Note a RecyclerView is a more powerful listview, which was introduced into android 5 and the support.v7 library.

<b>RecyclerViewDemo2</b> is more complex version using RecyclerView and CardView (support.v7). This example uses the phonelist from the listview example as the data set.

<b>RecyclerViewDemo3</b> is a rewrite of the listdemo from the listview using RecyclerView and CardView (support.v7). It has everything in fragments and uses a viewpager to switch between the examples.

<b>RecyclerViewSwipeRefresh</b> based on RecyclerViewDemo, but adds a swipeRefreashLayout so the user can trigger a refresh of data.

<b>LotsofLists</b> is a complex demo using a Navigation bar and RecyclerView to display several different lists, plus you can add more items the lists and add more lists to the navigation as well.

<b>CallBacksDemo</b> uses a RecyclerView and shows how to setup a listeners and callbacks to pass data from the recyclerview adapter to the MainActivity (via a fragment).

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course and cosc 4735 Advance Mobile Programing course.  All examples are for Android.
