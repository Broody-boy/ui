Basic Android GUI/UI Examples
===========
These are pretty basic android GUI examples.

<b>FormExample:</b> show some simple views/widgets and listeners using only an activity

<b>FragFormExample:</b> show the same example as FormExample, except it all in the fragment.  The fragment is loaded in the xml.

<b>FragDemoSimple:</b> shows how to change between two fragments using a button in the main activity.


These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
All examples are for Android.
