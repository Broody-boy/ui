GUI/UI Examples
===========

Varying examples of UI code for the interface.

mvcDemo is an example using the Model-view-controller model.

NavDrawer show using the Drawer with the arrow for lollipop.  It also has some Material Design elements implemented

intentDemo show varying intents to say make phones calls, launch the browser, etc.

GuiDemo is an example using ViewPager (and fragments) to show different Widgets and layouts.

dialog Demo shows how to use the dialog in the 2.3.3 and 4.X methods (with and without fragments)

FormExample a simple (and bad) example of some widgets.  It is badly out of date and uses 2.2/2.3 design ideas


Note, Android studio has many problems.  The first is you can't import all of these projects as one big group (like eclipse did).  You will need to import project seperately.   

eclipse/  has the projects in the format that eclipse can read.  you should be able to have eclipse import the entire directory.



These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
