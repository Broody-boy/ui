Navigation Examples
==============

`legacy/` are old examples that are no longer updated.  

`MenuDemo` is examples are menus, popup menus, action buttons, and sub menus.

`NavDrawer` is google's drawer example, fixed with the new drawer toggle.  mainactivity has all the changes logged.

`NavDrawerDemo`  is a cleaned up version of the NavDrawer example . This example and the toolbarnavDrawerDemo are the same example, but uses the toolbar.  See pictures in the directories for the differences.

`NavDrawerFragDemo` is listview example using the listviewFragmentDemo from the listview directory.  Minor changes for color fixes for the drawer fragment.

`toolbarnavDrawerDemo`  uses a toolbar, instead of a actionbar.  The rest of the code is the same as the NavDrawerDemo. 

`ToolbarDemo` use a toolbar and not a actionbar.  The sytle is DayNight.NoActionBar. So the toolbar is added in the layout, seethe app_bar.xml and activity_mail.xml, plus main_activity.java for the bulk of the code.  Again device-4.4.png and device-5.0.png shows the design.  Otherwise the example really doesn't do anything.
