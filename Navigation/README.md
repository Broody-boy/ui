==============

`legacy/` are old examples that are no longer updated.  

`MenuDemo` is examples are menus, popup menus, action buttons, and sub menus.  all using the support.v7

`NavDrawer` is google's drawer example, fixed with the new drawer toggle.  mainactivity has all the changes logged.

`NavDrawerDemo`  is a cleaned up version of the NavDrawer example . This example and the toolbarnavDrawerDemo are the same example, but uses the toolbar.  See pictures in the directories for the differences.

`NavDrawerFragDemo` is listview example using the listviewFragmentDemo from the listview directory.  Minor changes for color fixes for the drawer fragment.

`toolbarnavDrawerDemo`  is a cleaned up version of the NavDrawer example, but uses a toolbar instead of the actionbar.  NavDrawerDemo and toolbarNavDrawerDemo are the same except for the actionbar and toolbar.  

`ToolbarDemo` uses the v7.toolbar and style pieces.  see the app_bar.xml and activity_mail.xml, plus main_activity.java for the bulk of the code.  Again device-4.4.png and device-5.0.png shows the design.
