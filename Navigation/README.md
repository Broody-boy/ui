`NavDrawerFragDemo` is listview example using the listviewFragmentDemo from the listview directory.  Minor changes for color fixes for the drawer fragment.

`ToolbarDemo` uses the v7.toolbar and style pieces.  see the app_bar.xml and activity_mail.xml, plus main_activity.java for the bulk of the code.  Again device-4.4.png and device-5.0.png shows the design.
